## Overview


Welcome to the Car Recommendation Expert System. This Prolog-based system is designed to assist users in finding the perfect car based on their specific preferences and requirements. The system uses a comprehensive knowledge base, including a wide range of questions and answers about budget, purpose, concerns, and personal preferences related to car purchasing. It also includes detailed descriptions of various car models to match the user's answers with the most suitable car options.



## Key Features

- Dynamic Questioning:
The details about adapting the questioning flow and the use of the progress predicate demonstrate a sophisticated approach to user interaction and data management. This adds depth to the understanding of how the system personalizes the experience.

- Rule-Based Recommendation:
Highlighting the intelligent matching system and its ability to handle diverse user responses showcases the system's complexity and adaptability.

- Fallback Mechanism:
This feature emphasizes the system's robustness, ensuring that users receive recommendations even if their criteria are unique.

- Feedback Recording:
Mentioning how feedback is used to enhance future recommendations demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement and user satisfaction.

- User Engagement:
This point underlines the system's focus on user experience, which is crucial for any interactive system.
